# Helitron DNA Machine Learning

Helitrons are rolling-circle transposable elements that play a significant role in genome evolution by capturing and reshuffling host genes. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based approach, specifically using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, to identify Helitrons in DNA sequences accurately. By analyzing their unique structural features and using hyperparameter tuning, the study achieves a binary accuracy of 99.82%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.
